**3. Functional Requirements**

**3.1 User Management**  
- **Authentication**: Users can log in, log out, and reset passwords securely.  
- **Account Creation**: New users can sign up by providing email, password, and basic profile information.  
- **User Entity**:  
  - Fields include: name, email, password hash, OTP hash, mobile number, permissions, and timezone.  
  - Each user must have at least one associated cashbook.

**3.2 Dashboard**  
- **Key Metrics**:  
  - Opening Balance.  
  - Total Inflows.  
  - Total Outflows.  
  - Closing Balance.  
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of cash flow trends over time.

**3.3 Cashbook Management**  
- **Attributes**:  
  - Current balance.  
  - Total transactions.  
  - Last transaction timestamp.  
  - Currency.  
- Each user can manage multiple cashbooks.  
- Transactions within each cashbook are segregated and summarized.  
- **Latest Transactions Caching**:  
  - The latest 10 transactions for each cashbook will be cached in Redis for optimal performance and quick retrieval.  
- **Caching Invalidations**:  
  - The cache will be invalidated whenever any update occurs in transactions or cashbook data.

**3.4 Transaction Management**  
- **Attributes**:  
  - Type (IN or OUT).  
  - Amount.  
  - Current Total Inflows.  
  - Current Total Outflows.  
  - Current Running Net Balance.  
  - Current Running Opening Balance.  
  - Associated cashbook.  
- **Add Transactions**: Input sender, receiver, amount, category, remarks, voucher number, and cashbook association.  
- **Search and Filter**:  
  - Filter transactions by date, category, sender, receiver, voucher number, or cashbook.  
  - Full-text search for specific transactions.

**3.5 Reports**  
- Generate and export financial reports in PDF or Excel format.

**3.6 Session Management**  
- **Caching User Sessions**: User sessions, including their permission level, will be cached in Redis for 20 minutes to ensure quick access to session data.  
- **Session Invalidations**: When a user logs out, the session cache will be immediately invalidated.

**3.7 Cache Management**  
- **Invalidations**:  
  - Any update in transaction, cashbook, or user session will trigger the invalidation of the respective cache stored in Redis.

**4. Non-Functional Requirements**

**4.1 Security**  
- Encrypt all sensitive data in transit and at rest.  
- Implement role-based access control.  
- User sessions will be managed via JSON Web Tokens (JWT), ensuring secure authentication and authorization.  
- Session data will be cached in Redis for high-performance availability and reduced latency.

**4.2 Usability**  
- Provide an intuitive interface with minimal learning curve.  
- Ensure accessibility compliance (e.g., WCAG).

**4.3 Performance**  
- Support up to 10,000 concurrent transactions without degradation.  
- Ensure response times under 3 seconds for user actions.

**4.4 Scalability**  
- Handle up to 10 million transactions in the database.

**4.5 Maintainability**  
- Modular architecture to support future feature additions.
